# treedots-technical-test

This is a repo for treedots technical test.

Created using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/).

Question 2 digit field in web page is limit at 255 characters.
However, unit test will cover larger characters test.

I have used charAt() to retreive the number at the position for question 2 since it is O(1) constant time.
